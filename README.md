### *LEAVING OUR MARK ON RETRO MAC!*


# ***We wanted to push the boundaries of graffiti.***

***As graffiti artists we always ask "What hasn't been tagged?"***

***Man has always asked "Is time travel possible?"***

***Open-Source software says yes.***

***Welcome to the past, welcome to Mac OS 9, a new playground for graffiti.***

***We are the Macintosh Graffiti Group - Tagging Mac OS 9.0.0 since 2021.***

### **HOW?**

SheepShaver, an open-source PowerMac emulator by Christian Bauer, gives users the tools needed to emulate classic MacOS operating systems and applications within the modern MacOS multitasking environment. Thanks to repositories such as [MacintoshRepository](https://www.macintoshrepository.org) and [MacintoshGarden](http://macintoshgarden.org), users are able to download vintage Apple software. Unsupported in the eyes of Apple inc. but cared for by the thousands of retro Mac enthusiasts today.

### **01. FIND COMPATIBLE ROM FILE**

Thanks to [MacintoshRepository](https://www.macintoshrepository.org), you are able to find an archive of compatible [Macintosh ROMs](https://www.macintoshrepository.org/7038-all-macintosh-roms-68k-ppc-). A ROM file is a computer file that contains a copy of the data from a read-only chip, like a computer’s firmware. Specifically the New World ROMs file allowed me to simulate a Mac from the mid 90s, similar to groundbreaking devies such as famous iMac G3.

### **02. FIND INSTALL CD IMAGE**

Mac OS 9.0.0 was chosen as the operating system. This was the last ‘classic’ operating system for the Mac, preceding Mac OS X, and by far the most polished of these 'classic' systems. It gave the widest compatibility for programs and it was easy to find compatible software and required files online.

### **03. START SHEEPSHAVER**

On your first boot of SheepShaver, you are greeted with an error, a blank grey screen with a tiny Mac icon holding a '?'. In similar fashion to a real Mac of the time, the user must enter the install CD. This is configured within the preferences of SheepShaver. By locating the ROM, the user creates a partitioned disk for this virtual machine, entering whatever virtual memory and storage they desire for the device. You can now reboot SheepShaver.

### **04. INSTALL SYSTEM**

SheepShaver should now boot into the Mac OS 9.0.0 installation page. If all previous steps were followed correctly, and after the installation process, SheepShaver should be a fully functioning classic Mac.

> Complete file list.


### **00. TAG MAC**

Now we start: tagging Mac. As the Macintosh Graffiti Group, we wanted to explore the possibilites of graffiti art within Mac OS 9.0.0. We chose to install Photoshop 6.0, a powerful tool for the time.

I allowed people to have a go at Mac OS 9. To many, it was a cool and especially nostalgic experience.

It taught us how much computers have advanced over the years, how appreciative we should be of these advancements that have improved our creative workflows. However, it's also taught us the similarities. Despite the obvious UI differences, Mac OS 9.0.0 was extremely similar to use as modern day Macs, as was Photoshop 6.0. Same shortcuts, same general layout - migration to the Mac OS 9.0.0 universe was not too difficult.
